    "### Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to discover potential drivers for the log error and from those drivers make predictions about log error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "We want to find drivers of log error with the hopes of reducing future log errors leading to smaller differences between log(zestimate) and log(sale price)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Questions\n",
    "<p>1) Does there appear to be some colinearity between columns?</p>\n",
    "<p>2) Is there a linear relationship between home size and log error?</p>\n",
    "<p>3) How does the mean log error compare between county?</p>\n",
    "<p>4) Is there a linear relationship between tax amount and log error?</p>\n",
