### Steps to Reproduce
## TO DO
You will need an env.py file that contains the hostname, username, and password of the MySQL database that contains the Zillow Housing data. The env.py file will need to be in the repository and filename verified or placed in the git ignore. Clone this repo and ensure acquire.py and prepare.py are on your local machine. Additionally, verify env.py is in the git ignore to ensure security of your login information. The technologies used in this project are Python 3.8.11, Pandas 1.3.4, MatPlotLib 3.5.0, Seaborn 0.11.2, Scipy 1.7.1, and SkLearn 1.0.1. The notebook named report.ipynb should run.

### Plan
## TO DO
The plan is to acquire the data either from a CSV or the MySQL database and perform some preparation steps. Then, I  will do some visualizations and compliment them with some statistical tests. Finally, I will do some clustering... I will fit on the training data and check for overfitting on with the validation data. I will then pick the best model to test and move into production. I will then discuss some recommendations and next steps I would like to do with this project.
